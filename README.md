### This project is only kept here for archival purposes.

Let these files stand as the relics of the early days of Exploration and Curiosity in the lands of Javascriptia & AppCacheus.
What a way to enter the world of connections that is the Internet.

And yes, those actually aren't APIs; they're just Javascript functions. I was just that weird before.

All actual API credits go to the devs at Google Inc. The rest is copypasta ala edit.

## About:

Probably my first attempts at anything tangentially related to programming.

## Credits:

* add2home (used in most of my web apps) - [https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen](https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen)
* speckedit - [http://speckedit.com](http://speckedit.com) (their website is missing a download link so I hosted it in my repository)
* APIs - credits and documentations are in the apis folder above
* Web Apps - credits are in the webapps folder above

## License:

"Licensed under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) (the license is embedded in every HTML or PHP file in all of my webapps).
All other files and webapps in this repository either have a respective license or do not have a license."

Or so I said before. Licenses are under whatever the licenses were for the sources and the APIs used. Definitely not MITL.

## Notes:

In these webapps' appcache files, you may notice that the version number is quite high.
Its only purpose is to update the apps after a change in one or more of the files. (More info on appcaches in [a now defunct webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20140911203145/http://appcachefacts.info/))
