## License:

My webapps and APIs are licensed under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) (the license is embedded in every HTML or PHP file in all of my webapps).

All other files and webapps in this repository either have a respective license or do not have a license.

## Notes:

In my webapp's appcache files, you may notice that the version number is quite high.
Its only purpose is to update the apps after a change. (More info on appcaches in [appcache.info](http://appcache.info))

You may also notice that the webapp's codes are quite messy and non-standard compliant.
I really don't have the time to fix those, so if you would like to contribute big in this project, you could fix (or at least shrink) those issues (either or both, it's up to you).

If you notice something else going wrong, leave a message to me at "simon_clemente at me.com" (no quote marks and replace the "at" with "@").
