{"body":"## Info:\r\n\r\nYou can download my web apps and its dependencies here. Just click on one of the download buttons to start.\r\n**You also get a bonus: [SpeckEdit](http://speckedit.com)!**\r\n\r\n\r\n## So what do I do now?\r\n\r\nYou can make a new web app out of my existing webapps, improve it (bug fixes, design changes, etc.), make it a real app (whatever platform you want!), whatever you can think of as long as you comply with the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits:\r\n\r\n### Web Apps:\r\n* tictactoe - [http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/tactoe.shtml](http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/tactoe.shtml)\r\n* qrgen & qrgenlite - [https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes)\r\n* htmledit - [http://www.javascriptsource.com/forms/html-preview.html](http://www.javascriptsource.com/forms/html-preview.html)\r\n* html5clear - [https://github.com/yyx990803/HTML5-Clear](https://github.com/yyx990803/HTML5-Clear)\r\n* svgui - version of sourceviewer (refer in the APIs) with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easily switching between websites (*in other words, a version of sourceviewer with an ability to navigate between websites*)\r\n\r\n### APIs:\r\n* sourceviewer - [http://eclecticdjs.com/mike/tutorials/php/files_04.php](http://eclecticdjs.com/mike/tutorials/php/files_04.php) for the main source viewing feature, [https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror2](https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror2/) for the code highlighting feature\r\n\r\n### Others (dependencies and other stuff):\r\n* add2home (used in most of my web apps) - [https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen](https://github.com/cubiq/add-to-homescreen)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notes:\r\n\r\nIn my webapp's appcache files, you may notice that the version number is quite high.\r\nIts only purpose is to update the apps after a change. (More info on appcaches in [appcachefacts.info](http://appcachefacts.info))\r\n\r\nYou may also notice that the webapp's codes are quite messy and non-standard compliant.\r\nI really don't have the time to fix those, so if you would like to contribute big in this project, you could fix (or at least lessen) those issues (either or both, it's up to you).\r\n\r\nIf you notice something else going wrong, leave a message to me at \"simon_clemente at me.com\" (no quote marks and replace the \"at\" with \"@\").\r\n\r\n\r\n## License:\r\n\r\nMy webapps and APIs are licensed under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) (the license is embedded in every HTML file in all of my webapps).\r\nAll other files and webapps in this repository either have a respective license or do not have a license (like the .js file in tictactoe).","note":"Don't delete this file!
