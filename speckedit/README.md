## Wait, this doesn't seem to be the real SpeckEdit!

I just added an appcache for this to work offline. That's it. You can choose not to make this work offline, just delete the appcache and remove the manifest attribute in the html tag in speckalicious.html.

You may consider speckalicious.html as the index.html of a website, containing the actual thing.

And BTW, that download.zip is just a compressed folder with all the files needed to run SpeckEdit (*And that appcache file mentioned above*).

## What's README.md then?

You're actually reading it right now. :)
