### This is the download page for SpeckEdit.

Just get download.zip and unzip to use it!
These files are extracted from the demo page in their website.

### Wait, this doesn't seem the same as the real SpeckEdit.

I just added an appcache for this to work offline. That's it. You can choose not to make this work offline, just delete the appcache and remove the manifest attribute in the html tag in speckalicious.html.

And BTW, that download.zip is just a compressed folder with all the files needed to run SpeckEdit (*And that appcache file mentioned above*).
