## add2home by cubiq

The purpose of distributing these files is for reference to the exact files and settings I used in my webapps.
If you want to change the looks of the add2home alert, I recommend you to download it from their website ([http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen](http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen</a>))

add2home-webapp.js is a modified version of add2home.js.
Its purpose is to show a different message in webapps and a different message in SR Tests.
